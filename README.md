IT ELECTIVE 3 - PREFINAL

Self-Assessment: Onion Architecture, MVC, and Web API (.NET Core)

Conceptual Understanding

Onion Architecture: No

MVC Pattern: Yes

Web API: No

Application & Bottlenecks

Onion Architecture

Benefits: Maintainability, Flexibility, and Scalability

Bottlenecks (Encountered): No, I haven't encountered any bottlenecks with Onion Architecture in my projects.

MVC

Components: The model manages the application's data. It needs user input from the controller. The view represents the model in a certain format. The controller processes user input and interacts with data model objects.

Bottlenecks (Encountered): No, I don't because this is my first time exploring the parts of MVC.

Web API

Differences from MVC: MVC can be used to develop a Web application that responds in both data and views, whereas the Web API is used to create HTTP services that only react in data. The Web API request traces actions based on HTTP services, whereas the MVC request traces the action name.

Bottlenecks (Encountered): No, I haven't encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs. As I said earlier exploring these two MVC needs much time, effort, and patience.
